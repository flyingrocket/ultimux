# ultimux

## Description

Start tmux sessions based on yaml config. A configuration (yaml) file may be passed to the script with the -c flag. Alternatively, you can browse and interact with ultimux dynamically. In that case, yaml files are expected to reside in ~/.ultimux/conf.d or /etc/ultimux/conf.d per default.

## Installation

Install tmux, e.g. in Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install tmux
```

Install pip packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

See -h for options:

```bash
./ultimux.py -h
```

## Examples

See examples in conf.d/ dir.
